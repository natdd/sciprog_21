Practical 5 includes
1. scanf.c
This program gets 2 inputs which are integer and long float. Then, it print these 2 inputs again. Also, it shows how pointer works by assign pointer as the integer input and compare value from assigned pointer and the input.
2. fibo.c
This program generate n fibonacci numbers which n is an input. It contains fibo function to sum up 2 numbers in the 2 addreses which are its arguments. Then, it assigns the new value to the number in the addresses.
3. arctan.c
This program calculates hypolic arc tangent with 2 different functions - 1. Maclaurin Series and 2. Logarithms. Then, it displays the difference of results between the functions by each precision (kept in array).

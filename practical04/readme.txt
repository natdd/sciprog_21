Practical 4 includes
1. trapezodial_v2.c
This is the same program as trapezodial.c in Practical 3 but we have some improvement below 
  - Create the function to convert degree to radian
  - Declare array to keep the results of Tan in each radian.
2. trapezodial_v3.c
Adjust trapezodial_v2.c by creating function traprule to calculate area. So, we can calculate the area in any number of equidistant points (N-1) depending on the input.
